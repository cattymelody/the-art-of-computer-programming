# The Art of Computer Programming

This repository contains my answers to the classic set of books, The Art
of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth. Some will be the answers in
a variety of programming languages I'm familiar with, others will be TEX
documents that can be compiled which contain proofs to certain
mathematical questions.

This set of books has been hailed as a way to fundamentally understand
computers and algorithms. While I'm almost done with my Bachelor of
Science in CS I feel like there's more to learn or some hidden pearl of
wisdom to learn. This repository exists to document my progression
through these challenges as well as a way for others to learn from them.

If you want a pdf version of all the files just run the `tex2pdf.sh`
script. You'll need `pdflatex` installed for it to work.
