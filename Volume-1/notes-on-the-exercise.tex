\begin{enumerate}
  \item $[00]$ What does the rating "M20" mean?
    \\\\
    It means that the question is mathematically oriented. It should
    take about 15 minutes or so to complete
  \item $[10]$ Of what value can the exercises in a textbook be to the reader?
    \\\\
    While one can read a book people learn best by actually answering questions
    testing what they learned. This struggle to answer questions or failing
    after having really tried can lead to greater understanding of the material.
    Just reading the textbook does not reinforce the material like doing
    exercises that cover it.
  \item $[14]$ Prove that $\displaystyle 13^3 = 2197 $. Generalize your answer.
    $[$This is an example of a horrible kind of problem that the author has
    tried to avoid$]$
    \\\\
    We know that \[13^n \]
    Can be represented as \[13_1 * 13_2 * ... * 13_n\]
    In the case of $\displaystyle 13^3 $ we can expand this out to
    \[13 * 13 * 13\]
    \[13 * 13 = 169\]
    \[13 * 169 = 2197\]
    Therefore \[13^3 = 2197\]

  \item $[HM45]$ Prove that when \textit{n} is an integer, $\displaystyle n>2 $,
    the equation $\displaystyle x^n + y^n = z^n $ has no solution in positive
    integers \textit{x,y,z}.
    \\\\ Will come back to later.
